# dockertools

Collection of useful tools/scripts for Docker

## scripts

* [dockertags](https://github.com/tellmejeff/dockertools/blob/master/scripts/dockertags) - lookup the tags for an image on Docker Hub
* [docker-clean](https://github.com/ZZROTDesign/docker-clean) - not my script, but is essential for cleaning up old docker containers, images, and networks
* [ctsh](https://github.com/tellmejeff/dockertools/blob/master/scripts/ctsh) - execute shell commands on a named container
* [docker-relay](https://github.com/tellmejeff/dockertools/blob/master/scripts/docker-relay) - a relay that allows you to run docker commands inside of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) by connecting to the Docker for Windows engine
